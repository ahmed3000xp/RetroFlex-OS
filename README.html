<h1>RetroFlex OS</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>RetroFlex is a UNIX-like OS compatible with GNU+Linux programs and its own programs.</p>

<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>

<h3>For Windows Users:</h3>
<p>If you are using Windows, you'll need to install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and then install a GNU+Linux distribution through the Microsoft Store.</p>

<h3>For Debian/Ubuntu/Ubuntu-based Systems:</h3>
<pre><code>sudo apt install grub2 qemu-system-x86 nasm gcc make parted dosfstools</code></pre>

<h3>For Fedora Systems:</h3>
<pre><code>sudo dnf install nasm qemu grub2 virt-manager virt-viewer dnsmasq vde2 bridge-utils nmap-ncat @development-tools bison flex gmp-devel libmpc-devel mpfr-devel texinfo gcc make parted dosfstools</code></pre>

<h3>For Arch/Arch-Based Systems:</h3>
<pre><code>sudo pacman -Syy nasm grub virt-manager virt-viewer dnsmasq vde2 bridge-utils openbsd-netcat base-devel bison flex gmp libmpc mpfr texinfo gcc make qemu-full parted dosfstools</code></pre>

<h2>Compiling and Running RetroFlex OS</h2>
<p>After installation, compile and run RetroFlex OS by executing:</p>
<pre><code>make all</code></pre>

<h2>Troubleshooting Permissions Issue</h2>
<p>If you encounter a permissions error during ISO creation, such as:</p>
<pre><code>qemu-system: Could not open '../disk.img': Permission denied</code></pre>
<p>Try running the script with elevated privileges using <code>sudo</code>:</p>
<pre><code>sudo make all</code></pre>

<h3>Running on x86 Hardware</h3>
<p>If you have an x86-based Computer, you can run the OS on the CPU itself by running:</p>
<pre><code>make qemu_native</code></pre>

<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Did you know?</strong> RetroFlex OS was created by a furry who is also an Arch user. He claims his choice of operating systems is as eclectic as his sense of humor!</li>
    <li><strong>Quirky Code:</strong> The developer once tried to program RetroFlex OS while juggling flaming torches. Spoiler: It didn't end well, but the OS survived!</li>
    <li><strong>Unlikely Inspiration:</strong> The idea for RetroFlex OS came during a late-night snack attack when the developer mistook a pizza box for a new motherboard. Pizza might not be the best hardware, but it sure inspired some great software!</li>
    <li><strong>Arch Enthusiasm:</strong> It&#39;s rumored that the developer&#39;s love for Arch Linux is so strong that they even use Arch stickers to decorate their workspace. Rumor also has it that the stickers are more organized than their code!</li>
    <li><strong>Furry Fact:</strong> The developer claims that RetroFlex OS runs smoother when you pet your favorite plushie while compiling. Its unproven, but it might just be the secret to compiling success!</li>
    <li><strong>Global Touch:</strong>The mastermind behind RetroFlex OS is an Arab blending Egyptian flair with Saudi spice. And yes, their Muslim heritage might mean more prayers—specifically, when pressing Enter after typing <pre><code>make all</code></pre> in the terminal. It’s rumored that when he prays for a smooth compile, it actually works. Just don’t ask him how many times he had to pray!</li>
    <li><strong>How Many Times you did this:</strong>I think you cringed 1 to 2 times, when I said that I'm a furry and an Arch User. I think you LOLed (Laughed Out Loud) a lot from What I said!</li>

<h4>Note</h4>
<p>The kernel of RetroFlex-OS is being rewritten, because of issues in the code, being unstable, the code being so messy, etc.</p>
